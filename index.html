  <h3>Early life</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>Hickenbottom was born on July 22, 1965 in Chandler, Arizona The last of four children – Randy, Scott, and Shari are his older siblings – he was raised in a military family and spent a brief part of his early years in Reading, Berkshire,
    England, but grew up in San Antonio, Texas. As a child, Hickenbottom disliked the name Michael, so his family and friends just called him Shawn. Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently
    since his father was in the military.</li>
  <li>He knew he wanted to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling">professional wrestler</a> at the age of twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake blood.
    Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the
    age of six when he started playing football. He was a stand-out linebacker at Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base and eventually became captain of the football team. After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Southwest Texas
    State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that college life was not for him. He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.</li>
